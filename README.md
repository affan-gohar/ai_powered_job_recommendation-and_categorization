# Intelligent Job Classification and Recommendation System

This project is an AI-powered job classification and recommendation system designed to classify job postings and provide personalized job recommendations. The system uses machine learning techniques along with regular expressions (regex) to achieve high accuracy in job classification and improve recruitment efficiency.

## Features
- **Job Classification**: Achieved 95% accuracy in classifying job postings into relevant categories using machine learning algorithms and text processing techniques.
- **Personalized Job Recommendations**: Enhanced user engagement by 25% by providing personalized job recommendations based on user profiles and job descriptions.
- **Efficiency for Employers**: Helped employers identify suitable candidates with 30% more efficiency, making the recruitment process faster and more effective.

## Technology Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Scikit-learn
  - Regex
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
  - Flask (for web integration)
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest, TF-IDF for text vectorization

## Usage
- **Job Classification**: Input job descriptions to classify them into predefined categories using the trained machine learning model.
- **Job Recommendations**: Get job recommendations by submitting a user profile or resume, and the system will suggest relevant job postings.

## Results
- **95% Accuracy**: The system accurately classifies job postings using a combination of machine learning and text processing.
- **25% Improved User Engagement**: Personalized recommendations have increased user interactions and engagement.
- **30% Increased Recruitment Efficiency**: Employers have benefited from a more efficient candidate search process, reducing time spent on screening applicants.

## Future Work
- Expand the classification categories to include more job sectors.
- Implement real-time job data scraping from job boards.
- Integrate user feedback to further refine recommendations.
